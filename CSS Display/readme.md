## Points Regarding display
### display:block
* The element would break into the new line
* The element would become as wide as the container, filling up 100% of the space available
* Both width and height properties can be applied
* Padding, margin and border may cause other elements to be pushed away from the box
* examples are: ```<p>```, etc
<hr>

### display: inline
* the element would stay in the same line
* the element would wrap itself according to the size of the content within it
* Both width and hiegh properties cannot be applied
* horziontal padding, margin and broders can cause other inline boxes to move away from the box
*examples are: ```<a>```, ```<span>```, ```<em>```, ```<strong>```,etc.
<hr>

### display: inline-block
This is useful when you do not want your element to break into a new line but do want it to respect width and height and avoid the overlapping.
