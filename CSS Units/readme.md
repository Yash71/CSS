# CSS Units
## Lengths
There are two types of lengths used in CSS - relative and absolute.

### Absolute Length units
**Example: cm, mm, Q, in, pt, px, etc.**



### Relative Length units
They are relative to something, perhaps the size of the parent element's font, or the size of viewport. With proper planning, you make it so that the size of text or other elements scales relative to everything else on the page.

**Example: rem, ex, ch, rem, lh, vw, vh, vmin, vmax, etc.**
<hr>

## Percentages
They are always set relative to some other value. If you set an element's ```font-size``` as a percentage, it will be a percentage of the ```font-size``` of the element's parent.
